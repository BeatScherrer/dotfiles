Thanks for purchasing Dank Mono!
This zip file contains the font in various formats.
It's recommended to try the *.otf files first, since those
will stay the most true to fotn hints on higher resolution displays,
macOS, and Linux.
On Windows (and especially with IntelliJ Software) it may make
sense to use the *.ttf files instead if you're on a lower resolution
display for autohinting to work properly.
For websites, this zip includes *.woff2 files but also a dmvendor.css
file that can be used on its own and contains an obfuscated version
of the font.

Update 12/10/2020:
Re-exported the ttf files with decomposed "d" glyph since it was misrendering.
Updated the centre diacritic anchor on "l" to fix the "lslash" glyphs.
