### Overview

`snippetpanel.json` is generated by `dev/createSymbolSvgs.ts`. `snippetpanel.json` includes all the SVG texts to display the snippet panel. They are loaded by the extension host and are send to the Webview panel.

The content of the tab of `TikZ`, including SVG files, is directly written on the HTML file.
